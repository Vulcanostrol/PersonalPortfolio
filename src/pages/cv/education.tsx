              The Processes of Change track teaches you to understand change and to promote it in practice. The first
              few courses were creating theory and understanding of businesses and change. After this, I did a few
              consultancy projects for the university.

              In addition to this, the course had a focus on entrepreneurship and presentation skills. I was personally
              coached to improve my presentation skills and engage people with my communication.
