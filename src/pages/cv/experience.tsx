              I worked with <a href="https://gecosistema.com/" className="link-base">GecoSistema</a> during my master thesis. My thesis
              tackled hydrological level forecasting with <acronym title="Machine Learning">ML</acronym> in Italian
              rivers. This meant I had a good idea of the scientific landscape around hydrological forecasting algorithms
              and the state-of-the-art.

              After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Emilia-Romagna_floods" className="link-base">Emilia-Romagna floods</a> in
              2023, GecoSistema partnered with the European Union <a href="https://www.copernicus.eu/en" className="link-base">
              Copernicus</a> project. I was involved with the project because of my master thesis, and I was responsible for building
              a scalable system for hydrological forecasting in european rivers. This project will give european
              citizens earlier warnings about flash floods, making evacuation more effective.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              The project was done with <a href="https://pytorch.org/" className="link-base">
                PyTorch
              </a> and <a href="https://lightning.ai/pytorch-lightning" className="link-base">
                Lightning
              </a>. It required me to implement a new state-of-the-art <acronym title="Machine Learning">ML</acronym> model
              from scratch. After this, I trained the model, tuned it and deployed it as an API on a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" className="link-base">
                Kubernetes
              </a> cluster. Much more was involved in the project, and many things can still be improved about the system.
              However, the project was quite short (June/July were preparatory, August/September were for execution).

              Awaves was a startup that I co-founded with the mission of building an AI DJ. This DJ is
              able to create mashups and DJ sets automatically. I was the technical mind behind the
              startup and in true startup fashion, that means I had to do a lot of things:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
              <li>Choosing the technologies to be used for development</li>
              <li>Designing the software architecture</li>
              <li>Writing a lot of code</li>
              <li>Handling deployment, service uptime, telemetry, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="my-4">
              The list above contains the very basics, and obviously there was a lot more to it. However,
              I would also like to specifically outline some major responsibilities with regards to the
              startup being an AI startup:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Coming up with data strategies</li>
              <li>Setting up data pipelines</li>
              <li>Researching and creating ML models</li>
