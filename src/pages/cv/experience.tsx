              Awaves was a startup that I co-founded with the mission of building an AI DJ. This DJ is
              able to create mashups and DJ sets automatically. I was the technical mind behind the
              startup and in true startup fashion, that means I had to do a lot of things:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
              <li>Choosing the technologies to be used for development</li>
              <li>Designing the software architecture</li>
              <li>Writing a lot of code</li>
              <li>Handling deployment, service uptime, telemetry, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="my-4">
              The list above contains the very basics, and obviously there was a lot more to it. However,
              I would also like to specifically outline some major responsibilities with regards to the
              startup being an AI startup:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Coming up with data strategies</li>
              <li>Setting up data pipelines</li>
              <li>Researching and creating ML models</li>
              <li>Training, evaluating and optimizing ML models</li>
            </ul>
        </>
